# Playlists App

This app was created to mimic functionalities found in the Serato DJ software.

### The main functionalities are:

##### 1. Library

Here's were all the tracks available are loaded. 
The user would have the option to send any track to the Prepared Playlist or to a Specific Playlist.

##### 2. Prepared Playlist

This is the playlist that a user would use to keep tracks for a live event.
So they would have the ability to remove a track, mark it as played and even put it back.
